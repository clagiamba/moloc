  abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association
	study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into
	the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular
	cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge
	consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations.
	The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene
	expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed
	a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association
	signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application
	is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative
	trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be
	integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach
	by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with
	a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100,000 individuals
	of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis
	supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs
	and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting
	the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported
	eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests
	that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association,
	we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR,
	and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal
	in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability
	to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics,
	hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type
	comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at
	http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information
	about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct
	implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as
	the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},
